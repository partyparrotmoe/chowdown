tags: main, chicken, fried, deep-fried

ingredients:
- _Optional for brine:_ 1 quart water
- _Optional for brine:_ 1/4 cup kosher salt
- _Optional for brine:_ 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup Corn Flour
- 1 teaspoon Baking Powder
- 4 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 3/4 cup cold water

directions:
- _Optional Brining:_ Pound chicken to 1/2" - 3/4" thick (just to make sure it's even). Combine all brine ingredients in a large bowl until sugar/salt are dissolved. Add chicken, cover and refrigerate 1 hour.
- Combine flour, corn starch, baking powder and seasonings in a bowl. Remove 3/4 cup of this flour mixture and place in a shallow pan (this is the dry dredge).
- Add 3/4 cup cold water to the remaining flour mixture and whisk until smooth. You may end up with excess; this is normal.
- Heat oil over medium heat to 350°F in a Dutch oven or deep pan.
- Remove chicken breasts from the brine; pat dry with paper towels. Discard the brine.
- Dip the chicken breasts into dry mixture, shaking off any excess and then into the batter ensuring it's coated on both sides. Allow excess batter to drip off. Dip back into the dry mixture to gently coat.
- Carefully place chicken in the hot oil (ensuring it stays at 350°F). Cook until the chicken coating is a deep golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F, about 3-4 minutes per side (depending on thickness).
- Remove from oil and place chicken on a paper towel lined plate to drain.

Creates a really generic but tasty fried chicken. Works surprisingly well the next day in bento boxes, or hot in sandwiches.
