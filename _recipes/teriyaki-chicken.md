components:
- Teriyaki Sauce
- Japanese White Rice

ingredients:
- 300g Boneless Chicken Thigh

directions:
- Butterfly the chicken thighs to a uniform thickness by opening them up and scoring lines across the non skin-side - this will ensure even cooking
- Preheat a large skillet with some oil until the oil is shimmering (it's nearly ripping hot), then add the chicken **skin side down**
- Place a smaller lid over the chicken so it's in direct contact, then fry for 6 minutes.
- While the chicken fries, prepare and thoroughly mix the ingredients for the Teriyaki Sauce component.
- Once the skin side has browned, remove the lid, turn the chicken over, and using a piece of kitchen roll, blot up any excess oil in the pan.
- Add the Teriyaki sauce to the pan. Once it begins to bubble, baste the chicken by continuously spooning it over the chicken.
- Once the sauce begins to thicken, remove the chicken to a cutting board, then slice into strips around 1cm thick.
- Return all of the chicken back to the pan, and move it around to soak up the remaining sauce.
- Serve on rice.
