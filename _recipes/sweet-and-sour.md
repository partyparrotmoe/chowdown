components:
- Chinese Sweet & Sour Sauce

ingredients:
- 2 Chicken Breasts
- 1/4 cup Self-Raising Flour
- 1/4 cup Cornstarch / Cornflour (may need a touch more for thiccness)
- 1/4 tsp Salt
- 1/4 tsp Sugar
- 1/2 cup Water
- Frying oil

directions:
- Dice the chicken into 1-2" pieces.
- Preheat the frying oil to 190Â°C, either in a pan or a deep fryer.
- While waiting for the oil to come up, combine the flour, cornstarch, salt, sugar and water, and whisk until you end up with a thin batter.
- Dip the chicken pieces one by one in the batter, and then place them in the hot oil (minding your fingers!), being sure not to overload your oil.
- Fry for around 7-8 minutes until golden.
- Turn out onto a paper towel to drain. Rinse and repeat with the remaining chicken.
- Serve with the Sweet & Sour Sauce component.

This is a remarkably accurate clone of Sweet & Sour Chicken in Batter that you get from most chinese takeaways - in particular, the sauce is practically identical!

Useful notes:
1. The batter for the chicken will seem too thin - don't worry about it, it sticks to the chicken when frying and creates a nice and crispy coating.
2. Some people like to serve the sweet and sour sauce over the chicken itself - we don't recommend this as it makes the chicken soggy, but if that is how you are used to doing it, by all means go for it!
3. Cut your chicken into larger pieces, 2" work best for actual restaurant size!
4. When adding chicken to a deep fryer, make sure your basket is down and add one at a time, this prevents it from sinking and sticking the the bottom of the grates.

**Please be careful when working with hot oil** - if you haven't deep fried before, we'd recommend doing some research on the do's and don'ts.
