title:  "Japanese White Rice"

ingredients:
- Japanese White Rice
- A large mixing bowl
- A large, sturdy pot, **or**
- A rice cooker

directions:
- Add rice to mixing bowl, and add tepid water until it covers the rice. Using a clawed hand, gently agitate the rice until the water becomes cloudy, then drain as much water as you can.
- Repeat the above washing step until the water turns clear (or very close to clear). This can take some time, anywhere from 5 washes for very new rice to 15+ if it's been stored for a while!
- Once the rice is washed, move to your rice cooker or pot, and add 1.25x the quantity of rice in water (i.e if you're using 2 cups of rice, add 2.5 cups of water).
- Let sit for at least 5 minutes, ideally 25 minutes to soak.
- Rice cooker; Follow instructions on your rice cooker. On simple ones, just flick the switch down so the red light is on.
- Pan; Cover with a well fitting lid, then heat on medium-high until it reaches a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to roughly a simmer, then **DO NOT REMOVE THE LID** for 15 minutes.
- Once the rice cooker finishes or the pan has been boiling for 15 minutes, turn off the heat and **leave for 10 minutes**. This will steam the rice and produce much fluffier, defined grains.
- Using a spatula, turn the rice over itself and fluff it a bit to loosen it up.
- Serve in a bowl with chopsticks.
- Rice generally shouldn't be reheated, please use caution if you choose to.
